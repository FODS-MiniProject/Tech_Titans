This repository includes a MATLAB script, EDA_SmartPrescriptionSystem.m, that performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the data generated by the Smart Prescription System using AI. The input data (case_history.xlsx) is a log of simulated patient case histories captured via the smartPrescriptionGUI.

Input:
File: case_history.xlsx

Source: Generated by running smartPrescriptionGUI.m (must be executed at least once before running this EDA script)

Content Includes:

Patient Age, Gender

Symptoms (comma-separated)

Prescribed Medications (comma-separated)

What the Script Does:
1.Loads and Validates Data

  Reads the Excel file and displays a preview

  Validates data integrity and checks for missing values

2.Cleans and Standardizes Fields

  Splits and normalizes multi-entry fields like Symptoms and Medications

  Standardizes Gender values (e.g., M/F)

3.Performs Descriptive Statistics

  Mean, median, range, and standard deviation of patient ages

  Frequency counts of genders, symptoms, and medications

4.Generates Data Visualizations

  Histogram of patient ages

  Bar charts for gender, top symptoms, and top medications

  Scatter plot: Age vs. Number of Symptoms

  Boxplot of age grouped by gender

  Pie chart of gender distribution

  Correlation matrix heatmap of numeric features

5.Explores Relationships

  Average age by gender

  Top 3 most reported symptoms per gender
